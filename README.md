## About me

I got my Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Systems from the University of Tanta. 

I am a collaborative team player showcasing exceptional analytical and critical thinking abilities, adept at excelling in high-pressure corporate settings.

Now, I wish to exploit my analytical skills in software testing. 

Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. 

It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
